BUGS:
None are known as of 1/2/23

PURPOSE:
    Encrypts messages using Diffie-Hellman/Elgamal encryption. Messages can be 
    transferred with a good degree of security. Of course, this scheme has been 
    cracked, so don't use this to transfer sensitive information. Nonetheless, 
    feel free to use this program to understand an early cryptographic scheme
    and devise attacks on this scheme at your leisure.

FILES:

    Main.cpp: interfaces with the user and implements Diffie-Hellman encryption.

    SecuredInfo.h: header file for SecuredInfo.cpp.

    SecuredInfo.cpp: stores all the functions used in the encryption. Functions
    include generating prime numbers, modular arithmetic, conversion between 
    alphabetical text and base 10 integers, and a variety of functions that 
    carry out the actual encryption.

    Makefile: aids in linking all files above so that main can access the 
    objects and methods in a SecuredInfo.

PROGRAM RESTRICTIONS AND USE:
    *** Enter in a message of up to 5 characters composed only of English
    letters. Capital letters are allowed.
    
Future Improvements:
    *** Messages of arbitrary length and content will be supported
    *** Various attacks on the encryption will be implemented to illustrate the 
    vulnerabilities of the Diffie-Hellman encryption.
    *** Prime numbers will be tested deterministically in polynomial time with
    the number of digits according to the contents of the paper "Primes is P."
